                <p>The milky way galaxy is a collection of stars dust and gases. This galaxy is where our solar system exist.
                Space is very vast and is forever expanding, and our focus will be on <strong>The mily way</strong>. 
                Well look soem of the plannets within our solar system, the biggest stars, as well as astroid fiels that exist within
                our galaxy.

            <h2>name origin</h2>
            <p><strong>The Milky Way</strong> gets its name a greek myth of the godess <strong>Hera</strong> who sprayed milk across the sky,
                hence the name <strong>"Milky Way."</strong> Although this is th emoist common used name in western countries, other cultures 
                have their own names such as the <strong>"Silver Ring"</strong> in china, and <strong>"Backbone night"</strong> in parts of 
                North Africa.

                    <p> The shape to look at, is what we see in the night time. Usually just a dark spce with alot of stars.
                        If we were to take ourselves out of our inviroment and look up to it it might be a formless circle, 
                        that lights up.

                    <p>For a better visual, on the way <strong>the milky way</strong> is actually shapped like, the side profile gives us a better example.
                        from the side it would look like a giant, thin disk with a alight dent in the center. the flat shap is cause by
                        the galaxy spinning around, and without gravity all of the plannets would fly off.
